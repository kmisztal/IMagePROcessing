/**
 * To sharpen the image is very similar to finding edges, add the original
 * image, and the image after the edge detection to each other, and the result
 * will be a new image where the edges are enhanced, making it look sharper.
 * Adding those two images is done by taking the edge detection filter from the
 * previous example, and incrementing the center value of it with 1. Now the sum
 * of the filter elements is 1 and the result will be an image with the same
 * brightness as the original, but sharper.
